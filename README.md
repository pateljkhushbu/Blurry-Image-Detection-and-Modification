# Blurry-Image-Detection-and-Modification
A Python based application that's used to detect the blurriness of an image and  could be modified by using different filters.

This project Includes 3 Important sections: 
1. Detecting the Bluriness of exisiting images.
2. Detecting the Bluriness of live images. 
3. Applying Filters to make the images reusable.

Note: 
This Project is a inspired from Blur detection with OpenCV by Andrian Rosebrock. 
I have made a few changes such as including a gui, using a live camera and modifing the images by applying fiters.
